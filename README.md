# Unhandled Database Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers that interact with a database.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Problem

The `bug.js` example lacks error handling for database queries. If the database query fails (e.g., due to a network error, invalid user ID, or database issue), the application will either crash or respond with a generic error, leading to a poor user experience. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to add error handling using a try-catch block or callbacks to handle potential errors gracefully. The improved version sends appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 for internal server errors) and provides informative error messages to the client.
